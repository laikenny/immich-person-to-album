# Immich automatic Person -> Album

Automatically add people (faces) to an album and keep that album up-to-date. You can then share that automatic person-album 
with another user (for example, a shared album of your children).

You can arbitrarily add any face/person to any album. So you could make a "Family" album which contains all your family 
members and is automatically updated.

You can use API keys from any number of Immich users, so the one Docker container can handle doing automatic
albums for all your users.

## Setup

Take a copy of the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/alangrainger/immich-person-to-album/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file.
```yaml
services:
  immich-person-to-album:
    image: alangrainger/immich-person-to-album:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

There are two methods for specifying the config options:

### Configure via `config.json` file

1. In the folder which contains your `docker-compose.yml` file, create a `/data/` folder.
2. Inside the `data` folder, put a copy of [config.json](https://github.com/alangrainger/immich-person-to-album/blob/main/data/config.json.example).
3. Edit the `config.json` file as required.

### ...or via Inline configuration

Alternatively, you can add the configuration inline in your `docker-compose.yml` file like this:
```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      CONFIG: |
        {
          "immichServer": "http://192.168.0.20:2283",
          "schedule": "*/30 * * * *",
          "users": [
            {
              "apiKey": "XXXXXXXXXX",       # Immich user's API key (read-only access)
              "personLinks": [
                {
                  "description": "Photos of Joe",
                  "personId": "YYYYYYYYYY", # Joe's person ID
                  "albumId": "ZZZZZZZZZZ"   # Shared album ID
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
```

### Create an API key

1. Open Immich on desktop
2. Click on your profile picture
3. Click **Account Settings**
4. Go to API Keys
5. Click **New API Key**
6. Give it a name
7. Add the permissions of `asset.read` and `albumAsset.create`
8. Click **Create**
9. Copy the new API key and put it in your config file 

### Get your person and album IDs

Person IDs: 

- Immich → Explore → People → Click person → Copy ID from URL
- Example URL: http://your-server/people/f3437c84-83f9-4e84-9640-0dcd12efd08e
- Person ID: f3437c84-83f9-4e84-9640-0dcd12efd08e

Album IDs:

- Immich → Albums → Click album → Copy ID from URL
- Example URL: http://your-server/albums/ff85e8c5-32e6-49e0-a0ad-e4dd7ef66bce
- Album ID: ff85e8c5-32e6-49e0-a0ad-e4dd7ef66bce

## Troubleshooting

Make sure you can access your Immich API from inside the `immich-person-to-album` container. Run this command from outside the container, making sure to replace the address with your Immich server address:
```bash
docker exec immich-person-to-album sh -c "wget -qO- http://192.168.0.20:2283/api/server/ping"
```

It will return `{"res":"pong"}` if Immich is accessible to the `immich-person-to-album` container.

## Extended Features (Fork by laikenny)

This fork adds support for advanced filtering operations including AND, OR, NOT, and exclusive filtering.

### Supported Operations

#### OR Operation (Default)
Get photos with ANY of the specified persons:
```json
{
  "description": "Either kid",
  "personIds": ["person-a-id", "person-b-id"],
  "operation": "OR",
  "albumId": "album-id"
}
```

#### AND Operation
Get photos with ALL specified persons together:
```json
{
  "description": "Both kids together",
  "personIds": ["person-a-id", "person-b-id"],
  "operation": "AND",
  "albumId": "album-id"
}
```

#### NOT Operation
Exclude specific persons from results:
```json
{
  "description": "Person A without Person B",
  "personId": "person-a-id",
  "excludePersonIds": ["person-b-id"],
  "albumId": "album-id"
}
```

#### Exclude Others
Get photos with ONLY the specified persons (no one else in the photo):
```json
{
  "description": "Family of 4 only - no one else",
  "personIds": ["dad-id", "mom-id", "kid1-id", "kid2-id"],
  "operation": "AND",
  "excludeOthers": true,
  "albumId": "album-id"
}
```

### Combined Operations Examples

**OR + NOT**: Photos with Person A or B, but not Person C
```json
{
  "personIds": ["person-a-id", "person-b-id"],
  "operation": "OR",
  "excludePersonIds": ["person-c-id"],
  "albumId": "album-id"
}
```

**AND + NOT**: Photos with both Person A and B, but not Person C
```json
{
  "personIds": ["person-a-id", "person-b-id"],
  "operation": "AND",
  "excludePersonIds": ["person-c-id"],
  "albumId": "album-id"
}
```

**Solo photos**: Just one person, no one else
```json
{
  "personId": "person-a-id",
  "excludeOthers": true,
  "albumId": "album-id"
}
```

**Parents-only date night photos**: Any parent but no kids
```json
{
  "personIds": ["dad-id", "mom-id"],
  "operation": "OR",
  "excludeOthers": true,
  "albumId": "album-id"
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | string | No | Human-readable description of this rule |
| `personId` | string | Yes* | Single person ID (original syntax) |
| `personIds` | array | Yes* | Array of person IDs for multi-person operations |
| `operation` | string | No | `"OR"` (default) or `"AND"` |
| `excludePersonIds` | array | No | Person IDs to exclude from results |
| `excludeOthers` | boolean | No | If true, exclude all persons not in `personIds` |
| `albumId` | string | Yes | Target album ID |

*Either `personId` or `personIds` must be specified.

### Limitations

**Unsupported nested boolean operations:**
- `(A && B) || (C && D)` - Cannot express "both A and B, OR both C and D"
- `A && (B || C)` - Cannot express "A and either B or C"
- `(A || B) && (C || D)` - Cannot express complex nested conditions

These require nested boolean logic which is not currently supported. For most use cases, the combination of AND, OR, NOT, and excludeOthers operations should be sufficient.

### Backward Compatibility

All original configuration syntax remains fully supported. Existing configurations will continue to work without modification.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to https://github.com/ajb3932/immich-partner-sharing for the idea and for some of the readme text.

The only reason for making this project is that at time of release, the above project [hadn't been updated](https://github.com/ajb3932/immich-partner-sharing/issues/4) to support Immich 2.x.
